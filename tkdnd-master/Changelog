        * library/tkdnd.tcl: Allowed ::tkdnd::drag_source to accept multiple
        mouse buttons, as the event that initiates a drag action.

        * library/tkdnd.tcl: Merged pull request #36.
        (https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd/pull/36).

        * unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Changed how TkDND_GetToplevelFromWrapper()
        selects the topelvel. Patch from Florian Pigorsch.
        (https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd/issues/34)

2019-07-14  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * doc/tkDND.n:
        * doc/tkDND.htm: Updated documentation to reflect the changes in the
        %b and %m binding substitutions.

2019-07-13  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * CMakeLists.txt:
        * configure.ac: Added checks for X11/XKBlib.h, defining
        HAVE_X11_EXTENSIONS_XKB_H if found.

        * demos/dndSpy.tcl: Updated the demo code to show pressed mouse buttons
        and modifier keys.

        * library/tkdnd_generic.tcl: Fixed Bug #35, where mouse buttons were
        reported together with modifier keys:
        (https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd/issues/35)

        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl: Fixes for using the new
        "_keyboard_get_state", and correctly report the pressed mouse keys and
        modifiers.

        * unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Added support for the Xkb extension, and added
        support (and a new Tcl-level command, "_keyboard_get_state") for
        getting the pressed mouse buttons/modifiers under Unix. This relates
        to Bug #35 (https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd/issues/35). However,
        under Unix, the drop target is not supposed to decide on the action:
        it is the drag source that takes this decision. The drop target must
        either accept the action provided by the drag source, or replay with
        "copy" or "ask". This must be reflected in the documentation.

2019-07-12  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
        * library/tkdnd_generic.tcl: Added a new parameter for drag source
        action on HandlePosition.

        requested by the drag source to tkdnd::xdnd::HandleXdndEnter.

        * unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Fix in TkDND_GetToplevelFromWrapper(), to take
        into account a menu, if it exists. Fixed bug #34:
        (https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd/issues/34)

2019-06-13  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>

        * VERSION:
        * CMakeLists.txt: Added a VERSION file. CMake reads version from this
        file. Merged pull request #28.
        (Fixes bug #26 https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd/issues/26).

2019-02-03  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * library/tkdnd.tcl: Added conversion from utf-8 in
        ::tkdnd::urn_unquote.

        * demos/text_widget_demo.tcl: New demo, demonstrating tkdnd::utils for
        the text widget.

        * library/tkdnd_utils.tcl: Added a new package (tkdnd::utils) with
        utility functions (i.e. ::tkdnd::text::drag_source/
        ::tkdnd::text::drop_target that can be used for text widgets,
        to facilitate drag/drop in such widgets).

        * library/tkdnd.tcl: Fixes in ::tkdnd::drag_source(): The TkDND_Drag
        binding tag is now placed before the widget class.

        * win/TkDND_OleDND.h: Fixed a memory leak in Drop(), where
        Tcl_IncrRefCount() was called instead of the correct
        Tcl_DecrRefCount().

2018-10-28  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * demos/basic.tcl: Added a drag source that sends an empty string.

        * macosx/macdnd.m: Fixed bug #21
        (https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd/issues/21), where an image of size

        * tcl-conf: Added more checks, needed for macOS.

        * macosx/macdnd.m: macOS 10.7/10.12/10.13 deprecated some definitions (
        NSDragPboard, NSLeftMouseDragged, NSLeftMouseDownMask) and some
        functions (convertScreenToBase) we use. Alternatives have been used.
        "dragImage:at:offset:event:pasteboard:source:slideBack:" is also
        deprecated in 10.7, but is more difficult to be replaced.

2018-06-29  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * tcl-conf: Added a quick check to locate tclConfig.sh & tkConfig.sh,

        for %x, %y mouse coordinates (relative to window that is the drag
        source). Added the ability to stop a drag on the drag source. The
        <<DragInitCmd>> binding must return either "refuse_drop"
        as a value (instead of a list), or use
        "return -code break"|"return -code continue".

        * macosx/macdnd.m: Added support for complex sources under OS X.

        * CMakeLists.txt: A few fixes for OS X.

        * demos/complex_source.tcl:
        * demos/simple_source.tcl: Ensure returned paths are absolute (to avoid
        warnings under OS X).

2014-08-06  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl: Added support for sources with multiple
        and (incompatible) types under Unix. Completed implementation started
        on 2014-01-05 for Windows. OS X support is still pending.

        * unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Replaced calls to (deprecated)
        XKeycodeToKeysym(), with calls to XGetKeyboardMapping().

2014-08-04  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl: Fixed a bug where successive drags may
        be canceled, by a delayed XDNDFinished event, which is scheduled by
        xdnd::_SendXdndDrop to occur after 10 seconds (as a protection against
        a failed selection transfer by the client).
        Bug reported by Csaba Nemethi.

2014-01-05  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * doc/tkDND.n: Updated the man page.

        * demos/complex_source.tcl:
        * demos/simple_source.tcl:
        * demos/simple_target.tcl: New demos.

        * win/OleDND.h:
        * win/TkDND_OleDND.cpp:
        * library/tkdnd.tcl:
        * library/tkdnd_windows.tcl: Added support for sources with multiple
        and (incompatible) types, that require different data to be dropped. The
        changes affect the <<DragInitCmd>>, where there are now to types of
        return values expected from the event. Changes have been tested only
        under Windows. Unix/OS X not yet implemented.

        * demos/basic.tcl: Added information about the cross-platform dropped
        type.

2012-11-27  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
        * library/tkdnd_windows.tcl: Leave and Drop events do not report 0
        as root x/y (%X %Y). In case the underlying protocol does not support
        reporting the mouse coordinates for the specific event, the last known
        position from the position event is used.

2012-08-26  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        TkDND 2.6 released.
        * unix/tkUnixSelect.c: Added a work-around for getting the selection
        under unix: since Tk does not always deliver SelectionNotify, we try
        to get the selection even if SelectionNotify has not been received.

2012-08-15  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * unix/tkUnixSelect.c: Partially solved the problem with getting
        selection under unix. The solution was to try and get the selection,
        even if a SelectionNotify event has not been delivered.

2012-07-14  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * unix/tkUnixSelect.c: Tests with Tcl_ThreadAlert(). It helps
        somewhat, but is not the solution for the problems when getting the
        selection.

2012-06-17  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        TkDND 2.5 released.
        * win/TkDND_OleDND.cpp: Fixes for type CF_HDROP.

2012-06-07  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * demos/basic.tcl: Updated demo with support for colours, which only
        works for XDND right now.

        * unix/TkDND_XDND.c:
        * unix/tkUnixSelect.c: Implementation of unix (XDND) drags completed.

2012-06-06  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * unix/Cursors.c: Ported cursors from TkDND 1.x to TkDND 2.x

2012-06-05  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * library/tkdnd.tcl:
        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
        * unix/tkUnixSelect.c:
        * unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Added support for initiating drags from Tk under
        unix. Despite incomplete, seems to work with GTK.

2012-06-02  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
        * unix/TkDND_XDND.c:
        * unix/tkUnixSelect.c:
        * unix/tkSelect.h: Modifications to support Linux drops. Drops from
        GTK seem to always work, and drops from Qt seem to work most of the
        times.

2012-04-19  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * win/Makefile: Updated the Windows Makefile, after a patch from
        Dave Bodenstab.

2012-04-12  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        TkDND 2.4 released.
        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
        * unix/TkDND_XDND.c:
        * unix/tkUnixSelect.c:
        * unix/tkSelect.h: Modifications to support Linux drops.

        * tclconfig/*:
        * configure.in, Makefile.in: Updated to TEA 3.9.

        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl: Removed braces from a comment in
        xdnd::_GetDroppedData, left from testing with TIP 370 preliminary
        implementation. SF Bug ID: 3516862

2012-03-03  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        TkDND 2.3 released.
        * library/tkdnd_windows.tcl:
        * win/OleDND.h:
        * win/TkDND_OleDND.cpp: Fix in TkDND_DropSource::QueryContinueDrag,
        to support dragging with all mouse buttons. Bug reported by
        Michael Fersch.

2011-09-24  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * win/OleDND.h: Added definition of WINVER to version 5, when compiling
        with MinGW, which defines it with version 4. SF Bug ID: 3411338.

2011-09-23  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * win/OleDND.h: Modified STRING_(s), to ease compilation with MinGW.
        Patch provided by Hans-Christoph Steiner. SF Bug ID: 3411338.

2011-09-22  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * win/OleDND.h: Added a check if CF_DIBV5 is defined (i.e.
        WINVER < 0x0500). SF Bug ID: 3411338.

2011-03-18  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl: Fixed a bug in xdnd::_GetDroppedData, where
        an improper error was thrown in case no common types were found between
        the drag source and drop target widgets. Now a more appropriate error
        is returned. Bug reported by Kevin Walzer.

2011-01-14  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl: Added support for accepting drops, if
        TIP 370 is finally approved. Changes tested with a preliminary TIP 370
        implementation.

        * library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl: Fixed a bug reported by Kevin Walzer:
        macdnd::_GetDroppedData and xdnd::_GetDroppedData were missing the
        "time" argument, added in the XDND section for TIP 370 (if it gets
        accepted).

        * macosx/macdnd.m: Restored back a workaround by Kevin Walzer, as
        TkDND does not work well under all circumstances in OS X 10.6.
        (Reported by Kevin Walzer on 23 Dec 2010).

2010-08-03  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        TkDND 2.2 released.
        * library/tkdnd_windows.tcl:
        * win/OleDND.h: Fixes for compiling with UNICODE & _UNICODE.

2010-07-28  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * win/Makefile: Updated.

        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
        * library/tkdnd_windows.tcl: Fixed bug 2169256.

        * library/tkdnd.tcl: Fixed bug 2486830.

2010-06-16  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * Makefile.in:
        * configure.in:
        * win/Makefile:
        * win/TkDND_OleDND.cpp:
        * unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Applied a patch from Andreas Kupries, which
        make the unix code compatible with compilers supporting C89 (i.e.
        AIX's cc). Also, the TEA files were updated.

        * /unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Fixed a bug in TkDND_RegisterTypesObjCmd.
        It seems that KDE wants the XdndAware property on the window these
        days, and not at the toplevel one.

2010-06-11  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        TkDND 2.1 released.

2010-05-05  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Several fixes. The most important are:
        Do not initiate a drag if the clipboard is empty (i.e. because we
        cannot handle any of the provided types).
        Fixed drag icon slide when the drag is canceled.

2010-04-30  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Several changes:
        Moved drag operation inside TkDND_DoDragDropObjCmd. This means that
        drag operation can be started with a Tk binding.
        Fixed the way drag types are declared in the drag clipboard. Now types
        are reported correctly during drops.
        Added a tag in the DNDView class.
        Added a function to get the DNDView pointer from an NSView pointer.
        Hopefully this will not permit to add more than one DNDView to any
        view. This function always return a DNDView pointer (it creates a
        new DNDView if a view does not already has one).

        The demos seem to work, although the garbage collector seems to print
        some messages during drags from Tk windows.

2010-04-06  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Some attempts towards drag support for OS X.

2010-01-03  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Changed the way dropped data is handled: during
        the drop event the data are converted into a utf-8 string (in case of
        dropping string data) or a Tcl list object of utf-8 filenames (in case
        of dropping files). The data object is stored directly in the
        tkdnd::macdnd::_dropped_data variable, instead of the selection
        clipboard. _GetDroppedData was modified to return this stored data.

2009-12-30  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /cmake:
        * /CMakeLists.txt: Added support for building TkDND with cmake (i.e.
        under windows).

2009-12-29  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Changes to better integrate the work done by
        Kevin Walzer with the rest of TkDND, since OS X seems to mimic the
        XDND implementation. tkdnd_macosx.tcl is now a stub file, with most of
        the work being done by the unix (XDND) code.
        I think that OS X drop support is now working.

2009-12-09  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Updates to better integrate the OS X type
        registration command with the rest of the TkDND internal API.

2009-12-01  Walzer Kevin    <kw@codebykevin.com>
        * /macosx/*: Initial support for drop targets under OS X (Cocoa).

2007-02-09  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Fixed a bug in TkDND_RegisterTypesObjCmd, where
        Tk_Parent was used to determine if a provided path was a toplevel.
        Replaced by a check through Tk_IsTopLevel.
        Bug reported by Alain Bertrand <alain.mp.bertrand@tele2.be>

2006-04-24  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * TkDND version 2.0 started.
